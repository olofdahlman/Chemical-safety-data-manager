# Chemical-safety-data-manager
Short program for saving and organising safety data sheets for different chemical compounds into printable formats
Currently under construction, this code will enable you to create short sheets of critical information for different chemical compounds
These will be stored locally on your computer and you may then compile a list of all compounds you wish, and the program will then compile it into a printable form
The idea is that you can quickly compile all relevant safety information and print it for lab work rather than copying it by hand as I did once upon a time
Don't forget to use a lab-safe binder or similar to store the papers!
