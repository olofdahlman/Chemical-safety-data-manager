#This is where the graphical user interface (GUI) goes, to enable the user to interact with the program without strictly needing to know python
#Likely going to write it using tkinter
#Will need some different function calls to formatting to allow choosing different formatting styles, like ranked or type-based groupings

#The idea behind this class is to store the user-selected chemicals for an experiment in a way that enables ranking in appereance order
